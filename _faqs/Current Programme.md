<summary><strong>Who is eligible for the $300 and $100 Climate Vouchers?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>To be eligible for the Climate Vouchers, you must be a Singapore Citizen
or Permanent Resident registered and residing at an HDB flat, or a Singapore
Citizen registered and residing at a private residential property. Each
eligible household* is only entitled to one set of $300 vouchers and one
set of $100 vouchers.</p>

<summary><strong>I have claimed the $300 Climate Vouchers available from 2024. Am I still eligible to claim the additional $100 Climate Vouchers available from 2025?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Eligible households who have claimed their $300 Climate Vouchers can claim
the additional $100 vouchers to offset the upfront cost of any of the eligible
CFHP products during the programme period i.e. until 31 December 2027.
Eligible residents will receive the vouchers based on their registered
address at the point of claim.</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The enhanced Climate Friendly Households Programme (CFHP) aims to encourage
households to adopt energy- and water-efficient products by helping to
defray part of the upfront cost of the eligible products. As these energy-
and water-efficient products can be shared within the dwelling unit, multiple
families/tenants living in the same registered address are collectively
entitled to one set of $300 and one set of $100 Climate Vouchers for the
address. Only one member of the dwelling unit needs to claim the Climate
Vouchers and share the voucher links with the rest of the members.</p>
</div>

<summary><strong>I am the owner of the dwelling unit, but am not registered there (i.e. registered address as per NRIC is not at the unit). Am I eligible to claim the Climate Vouchers for that unit?</strong>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Climate Vouchers are intended for the residents of the unit to offset
the upfront cost of more resource-efficient appliances and fittings. In
this regard, the unit owner whose registered address is not at the unit
will not be eligible to claim Climate Vouchers for the unit.</p>
