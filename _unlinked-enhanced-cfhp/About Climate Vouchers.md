<h2><strong>About the Climate Friendly Households Programme</strong></h2>
<p>Launched on 28 November 2020, the Climate Friendly Households Programme
(CFHP) is a joint initiative by NEA and PUB which aims to encourage households
to take climate actions to be more efficient in their energy and water
consumption, while saving on utility bills in the long run.</p>
<p>The programme has been enhanced to benefit more households and provide
more resource-efficient products to choose from. From 15 April 2024, all
HDB households can claim <strong>$300 in Climate Vouchers</strong> to offset
the purchase of<strong> 10 types of energy- and water-efficient appliances and fittings.</strong>
</p>
<p>By switching to more efficient appliances and fittings, households can
reduce their energy and water consumption and benefit from lower utility
expenses in the long run.</p>
<p>Programme ends <strong>31 December 2027.</strong>
