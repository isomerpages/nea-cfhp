<h4><strong>How do I identify an eligible LED light in stores?</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>From 1 April 2024, NEA raised energy standards and introduced a revised
rating system (along with a refreshed Energy Label with a new 4-tick rating
scale) for lamps (<a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/enhancing-energy-efficiency-requirements-of-home-appliances" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">news link</a>).</p>
<p>The Climate Vouchers can be used to purchase 2-tick, 3-tick and 4-tick
LED lights that are based on the<strong> revised energy label.</strong>
</p>
<p>As suppliers are given a grace period of one year (i.e. until 31 March
2025) to update their energy labels, please look out for Climate Voucher
stickers or wobblers that indicate the products that are eligible for use
with the vouchers. Alternatively, you may approach the staff at participating
retailer outlets for assistance.</p>
