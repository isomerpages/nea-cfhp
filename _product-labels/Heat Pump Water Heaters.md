The programme will also be expanded to include Singapore Citizen households living in private residential property. <br><br> For more information, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions <a href="/interim-faq">here</a>. </div>

<h4><strong>How do I identify an eligible Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWHs) in stores?</strong></h4>
<p>Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWH) use the heat from the surrounding air to
heat water for your shower. In comparison, instantaneous and storage water
heaters use electricity or gas to heat water. This makes HPWHs more energy
efficient. They currently do not carry any energy label.</p>
<p>Given that retailers may offer different models, it is advisable to enquire
with them about the specific models that are eligible for purchase with
the Climate Vouchers.</p>
