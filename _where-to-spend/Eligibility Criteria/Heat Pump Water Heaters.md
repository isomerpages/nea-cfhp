<h4><strong>How do I identify an eligible Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWHs) in stores?</strong></h4>
<p>Rather than generating heat directly, Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWHs)
use electricity to move heat from the ambient environment to an insulated
water tank. This makes HPWHs more energy efficient than conventional electric
or gas water heaters. They currently do not carry any energy label.</p>
