The programme will also be expanded to include Singapore Citizen households registered and living in private residential properties. Eligible households may claim their Climate Vouchers from 15 April 2025 to 31 December 2027. <br><br> For more information, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions <a href="/interim-faq">here</a>. </div>

<h4><strong>How do I identify an eligible Direct Current Fan in stores?</strong></h4>
<p>Direct Current (DC) fans use DC motors which are more energy efficient
compared to Alternating Current (AC) motors. They are typically labelled
as “DC” by manufacturers and retailers. They currently do not carry any
energy label.</p>
<p>Stand fans, ceiling fans, and table fans that use DC motors are eligible
for purchase with the Climate Vouchers. DC fans with non-LED lights are
not eligible.</p>

<p>Given that retailers may offer different models, it is advisable to enquire
with them about the specific models that are eligible for purchase with
the Climate Vouchers.</p>
