The programme will also be expanded to include Singapore Citizen households registered and living in private residential properties. Eligible households may claim their Climate Vouchers from 15 April 2025 to 31 December 2027. <br><br> For more information, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions <a href="/interim-faq">here</a>. </div>
