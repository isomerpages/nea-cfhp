<h4><strong>How do I identify an eligible LED light in stores?</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Climate Vouchers can be used to purchase 2-tick, 3-tick and 4-tick
LED lights based on the<strong>&nbsp;energy label below. </strong>LED lights
with the old round energy label are not eligible<strong>.</strong>

<p>Note:<strong> </strong>From 1 April 2025, it is mandatory for all lamps
to carry the refreshed Energy Label with the 4-tick rating scale (<a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/enhancing-energy-efficiency-requirements-of-home-appliances" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">news link</a>).</p>

the Climate Vouchers.</p>
