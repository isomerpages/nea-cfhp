# About the Climate Friendly Households Programme


Launched on 28 November 2020, the Climate Friendly Households (CFH) Programme is a joint initiative by NEA and PUB which aims to encourage households to take climate actions to reduce energy and water consumption, while saving costs in the long run.

Under the Climate Friendly Households Programme, all 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB households can receive 3 separate e-Vouchers:
- **one $150 Climate Voucher** to offset the cost of an 3-ticks and above energy efficient and climate-friendly refrigerator,
- **one $50 Climate Voucher** to purchase 3-ticks water efficient shower fittings (including installation costs if required) and,
- **one $25 Climate Voucher** to purchase LED lights

If all eligible households make the switch, the collective reduction in carbon emissions is equivalent to taking 10,000 cars off the road and the water savings amount to 400 million gallons of water annually. Not only will this help fight climate change, households can benefit from utility savings from around $50 to $150 per household annually.
