Simply open up the voucher link, and present the voucher together with your NRIC at any of the participating retail stores. The cashier will scan the barcode on your voucher or key in the voucher number for you to be able to use the voucher. 

Please note that you will need the NRIC to be able to redeem your vouchers. 


**11.	Can I show a screenshot of the vouchers at the point of redemption?**

You are required to show the voucher in its original form (i.e. display your voucher on your mobile phone).

You may present your digital NRIC on the Singpass mobile application.

**13.	I have completed my purchase without redeeming the Climate Voucher, can I get reimbursed directly from NEA or PUB?**

Only participating merchants can redeem/accept the Climate Vouchers and the use of the voucher is also subject to the retailer’s own terms and conditions. You may check with your retailer if they can accommodate any request to redeem the vouchers.
