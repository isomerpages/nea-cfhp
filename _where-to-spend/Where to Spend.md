<p>Let’s play our part to recycle our electronic appliances when they are
due for replacement. This not only conserves Earth’s precious natural resources
but also protects human and environmental health.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>As per the Resource Sustainability Act, the retailer that delivers regulated
consumer products such as Air-conditioners, Refrigerators and Washing Machines,
is required to help you dispose of your unwanted/ old appliance of the
same product type for <strong><u>free</u></strong> upon request.</p>
<p>You may also dispose your old/spoilt LED light bulbs at <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/e-waste-management/extended-producer-responsibility-(epr)-system-for-e-waste-management-system" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">E-Waste Collection Points</a> located
