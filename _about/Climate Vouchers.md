<h2><strong>Climate Friendly Households Programme</strong></h2>
<p>Launched on 28 November 2020, the Climate Friendly Households Programme
(CFHP) is a joint initiative by NEA and PUB which aims to encourage households
to take climate actions to be more efficient in their energy and water
consumption, while saving on utility bills in the long run.</p>
<p>On 15 April 2024, the programme was enhanced to benefit more households
and provide more resource-efficient products to choose from. All HDB households*
can claim $300 in Climate Vouchers to offset the purchase of 10 types of
energy- and water-efficient appliances and fittings.</p>
<p>From 15 April 2025, HDB households* can claim an additional $100 in Climate
Vouchers, on top of the existing $300. The enhanced CFHP is also expanded
to include Singapore Citizen households* living in private residential
properties.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>eligible HDB and private households* can claim a total of $400 worth of Climate Vouchers</strong>.
The Climate Vouchers are valid until 31 December 2027 and can be used at
over 150 participating retailers with over 500 outlets to purchase energy-
and water-efficient household products.</p>
<p>* Multiple families/tenants living in the same registered address are
collectively entitled to one set of $300 and one set of $100 Climate Vouchers
for the same registered address/flat.</p>
