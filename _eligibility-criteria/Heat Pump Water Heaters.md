<p><strong>How do I identify an eligible Heat Pump Water Heater in stores?</strong>
</p>
<p>Rather than generating heat directly, HPWHs use electricity to move heat
from the ambient environment to an insulated water tank. This makes HPWHs
more efficient than conventional electric or gas water heaters. Heat pump
water heaters are typically not kept on display. You may approach the retail
staff in stores for assistance.</p>
